          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a newly graduated masterâ€™s student in Informatics at the
            University of Oslo, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I
            have a passion for creating engaging and meaningful experiences
            through design and technology. My background in computer science and
            design has given me a unique opportunity to combine the two
            perspectives to create innovative solutions. I am currently looking
            for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a designer
            and developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have experience working on a variety of projects, ranging from web
            and app development to interactive installations and tangible
            interfaces. I am proficient in a wide range of design and
            development tools, including Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React, and Arduino for instance. I am also familiar with
            user research methods, prototyping, usability testing, etc. I am a
            creative problem solver who enjoys working in teams and with the
            users to create impactful and user-centered solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy cooking, exercising, gaming, and hanging
            out with my friends on different occasions. In addition, I have
            multiple projects in the works which I am excited to talk with you
            about. I strive for design and technology and look forward to
            contributing to the field.

              "The Three Fundamental Qualities for Emotional Influence in
              Design"
            </h2>
            <p>
              This thesis explores the relationship between design and emotions,
              focusing on the fundemental qualities that influence emotional
              responses in design artifacts. Using Research through Design as
              the primary methodology, supported by Emotional-Driven Design
              principles, the thesis examines how these qualities contribute in
              creating emotionally engaging installations. The process involved
              four phases: data gathering, concept development, installation
              creation, and analysis. We identified three fundemental qualities
              through our thesis research: storytelling, sensory engagement, and
              familiarity. These qualities are crucial in fostering more
              immersive experiences. Additional elements like exploration,
              meaningful interactions, contrasts, and robustness can further
              enhance emotional engagement. The study provides both theoretical
              validation and practical guidance in design-oriented HCI and RtD
              methodologies, offering a framework for future research and the
              creation of emotionally engaging interactive artifacts.

              does not disturb the conversation. Another goal is its
              availability, therefore I made the decision to make it a web
              application, using React. The illustration is a prototype of the
              user interface and first game "Minesweeper".

              that helps hunters achieve a successful hunt using APIs from the
              Norwegian Meteorological Institute and Google Maps. Completed as
              part of the IN2000 Software Engineering course, the project won an
              award for the best app of the year. The app features a map that
              displays the user's current location along with weather forecasts
              and hazard alerts. Additionally, it includes a function for
              playing a selection of animal calls, recorded with real hunting
              instruments, to lure game within shooting range.

              This project addresses the challenges faced by young adults who
              spend long hours working in front of their computers. It includes
              developing a smart seat cover, "Ergotrekk," that detects poor
              posture through built-in pressure sensors. When users slouch or
              sit incorrectly, the cover gently vibrates to remind them to
              adjust their posture. With the "Dock", the user is able to control
              their product according to their needs, such as disabling it for
              meetings for instance. The Dock also displays the user's posture
              score at the end of the workday. This solution enables young
              adults to maintain proper ergonomics effortlessly, ensuring
              comfort and focus throughout their workday.

              This project focuses on empowering young adults aged 20 to 30 to
              become more environmentally conscious in their daily lives. By
              providing tailored information and actionable insights related to
              their everyday chores, the project aims to motivate this age group
              to adopt more eco-friendly habits. Through a user-centered
              approach, the project identifies barriers to sustainable behavior
              and offers practical solutions that are easy to integrate into
              daily routines. The ultimate goal is to transform environmentally
              friendly actions from occasional tasks into habitual practices,
              contributing to a greener planet.
