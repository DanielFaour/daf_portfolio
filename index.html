              "The Three Fundamental Qualities for Emotional Influence in
              Design"
            </h2>
            <p>
              This thesis explores the relationship between design and emotions,
              focusing on the fundemental qualities that influence emotional
              responses in design artifacts. Using Research through Design as
              the primary methodology, supported by Emotional-Driven Design
              principles, the thesis examines how these qualities contribute in
              creating emotionally engaging installations. The process involved
              four phases: data gathering, concept development, installation
              creation, and analysis. We identified three fundemental qualities
              through our thesis research: storytelling, sensory engagement, and
              familiarity. These qualities are crucial in fostering more
              immersive experiences. Additional elements like exploration,
              meaningful interactions, contrasts, and robustness can further
              enhance emotional engagement. The study provides both theoretical
              validation and practical guidance in design-oriented HCI and RtD
              methodologies, offering a framework for future research and the
              creation of emotionally engaging interactive artifacts.

              This is a drinking application that aims to create engaging games

              I am using React + Vite. Now featuring 5 games, including "1/16
              Minesweeper" and "Shot Roulette", which are shown on the image.
              The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible,
              allowing users to easily navigate and play the games.

              A Psychologist AI chatbot inspired by Baymax from Big Hero 6.
              Created using Angular and Typescript. The chatbot is designed to
              provide emotional support and assistance to users. It is
              essentially a simple web application using Grok API to generate
              responses. The application consists of a chat interface where
              users can interact with the chatbot and receive responses. The
              conversation is saved in local storage for the next visit, and the
              user can clear their conversation if desired. <br /><br />Note:
              This project is for educational purposes only and should not be

              This is a case task I did for a technical interview. It involved
              analyzing a dataset of 100,000 rows with 10 columns, where I had
              to find patterns and insights in the data. The task was to analyze
              and present the data and visualize what I thought was important in
              a way that is easy to understand for the user. I used Angular and
              Typescript to create this web application. The application
              includes a dashboard with various components, such as an
              interactive table, different kind of charts, and a map, to present
              the data.

              In this project, our goal was to develop an Android application
              that helps hunters achieve a successful hunt using APIs from the
              Norwegian Meteorological Institute and Google Maps. Completed as
              part of the IN2000 Software Engineering course, the project won an
              award for the best app of the year. The app features a map that
              displays the user's current location along with weather forecasts
              and hazard alerts. Additionally, it includes a function for
              playing a selection of animal calls, recorded with real hunting
              instruments, to lure game within shooting range.

              This project addresses the challenges faced by young adults who
              spend long hours working in front of their computers. It includes
              developing a smart seat cover, "Ergotrekk," that detects poor
              posture through built-in pressure sensors. When users slouch or
              sit incorrectly, the cover gently vibrates to remind them to
              adjust their posture. With the "Dock", the user is able to control
              their product according to their needs, such as disabling it for
              meetings for instance. The Dock also displays the user's posture
              score at the end of the workday. This solution enables young
              adults to maintain proper ergonomics effortlessly, ensuring
              comfort and focus throughout their workday.

              This project focuses on empowering young adults aged 20 to 30 to
              become more environmentally conscious in their daily lives. By
              providing tailored information and actionable insights related to
              their everyday chores, the project aims to motivate this age group
              to adopt more eco-friendly habits. Through a user-centered
              approach, the project identifies barriers to sustainable behavior
              and offers practical solutions that are easy to integrate into
              daily routines. The ultimate goal is to transform environmentally
              friendly actions from occasional tasks into habitual practices,
              contributing to a greener planet.

            <h1>Walleyway Game</h1>

            <p>
              During high school, in the subject "Information Technology 2", we
              were tasked with creating a game using only JavaScript, HTML, and
              CSS. I developed a remake of the classic Walleyway game which
              first debuted on Gameboy, where you control a paddle to bounce a
              ball and break bricks. Please note that the game was designed for
              slower computer hardware, so it may run at a faster pace on modern
              devices. Maybe you're up for the challenge?
